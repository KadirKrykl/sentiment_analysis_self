# Simple Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral.
*In this study, document vectors(doc2vec) and K-NN were used for Sentiment Analysis.*

## Data Set
Turkish movie reviews were used as the data set. In the "film_elimlari.zip" folder, there are raw text files and information about the people who collected these articles. Raw text files are divided into 3 folders, which are "positive, negative, neutral".

## Workflow
For detailed information, you can review the notebook page of the coding.
